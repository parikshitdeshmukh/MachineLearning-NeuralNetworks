# MachineLearning-NeuralNetworks
 * Machine Learning Projects on Single Hidden Layer and multi-layer neural network from scratch
 * Implmenting neural networks using TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch libraries

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and run the .py files individually. Use the built models to predict the new dataset.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
* Keras

      ```
      $pip install keras
      ```
* Matplotlib

      ```
      $ pip install matplotlib
      ```
* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) 

      ```
      $ pip3 install http://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu80/torch-0.2.0.post3-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl 
      $ pip3 install torchvision
      ```

## Testing

The built model has been tested on unseen USPS dataset.
